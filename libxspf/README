== About ==
libxspf is a C++ library that can help your application
to read and write XSPF playlist files (both Version 0 and 1).
Since version 0.6.0rc1 the library itself is licensed under
the new BSD license. The code of the test suite (files "test/*")
is still licensed under LGPL.

Please look at the "examples" folder to learn how to use the
reader and writer properly. You can also create API documentation
using Doxygen; this API documentation also contains a tutorial.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions on
integrating libxspf into your application.
