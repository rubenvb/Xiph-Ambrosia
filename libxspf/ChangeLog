      - uriparser 0.7.5 or later
      - pkg-config
      The libcpptest dependency can be disabled through
      configuring with --disable-test, which excludes the
      test suite from compilation.

      - configure.in renamed to configure.ac
      - some Autotools files moved to build-aux directory
      - Nested configure hacks resolved
  * Added: Qt Assistant documentation output:
      - Qt Compressed Help (.qch) at
          * doc/libxspf-doc-*.qch

      - Qt Help Project (.qhp) at
          * doc/html/index.qhp
          * bindings/c/doc/html/index.qhp
      Generation requires Doxygen 1.5.7.1-20081103 or later.

      can now be controlled from strict to loose.
  * Changed: Skippable errors (on XSPF level) and

      As a consequence a new error handler has been added:

      - SpiffExtensionReaderFactory
      - SpiffExtensionWriter
  * Changed: New error handling model introduced.
      Errors and warnings are now passed to the reader callback:
      - virtual bool SpiffReaderCallback::handleError(..)
      - virtual bool SpiffReaderCallback::handleWarning(..)
      In later versions of libSpiff it will be possible to continue
      parsing after above-XML-level errors and take control at this point.

      - Removed deprecated methods:
          * SpiffIndentFormatter::SpiffIndentFormatter(bool)

      - Renamed two functions in SpiffReader:
          * isURI -> isUri
          * isAbsoluteURI -> isAbsoluteUri
      - Required parameters for absolute external base URI added:
          * SpiffReader::parseFile(..)
          * SpiffReader::parseMemory(..)
          * SpiffReader::parseChunks(..)
          * spiff_c: spiff_parse(..)
          * spiff_c: spiff_write(..)
      - Moved SpiffWriter instantiation to a factory method:
          static SpiffWriter * SpiffWriter::makeWriter(..)
      - Removed old error handling methods:
          * SpiffReader::getErrorLine()
          * SpiffReader::getErrorText()
      - Moved static public helper functions away from SpiffReader:
          * extractDateTime(..) moved to SpiffDateTime
          * PORT_ANTOI(..) moved to anonymous namespace in SpiffDateTime
          * everything else moved to Toolbox
