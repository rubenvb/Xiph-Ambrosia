Design</a></h2>
libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and encoding audio data using codecs from <a href="http://www.xiph.org/">Xiph.Org</a>.<p>
libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in files, they are commonly encapsulated in <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/">Ogg</a> to produce <em>Ogg FLAC</em>, <em>Speex</em> and <em>Ogg Vorbis</em> files. Example C programs using <a href="http://www.annodex.net/software/liboggz/">liboggz</a> to read and write these files are provided in the libfishsound sources.<p>
libfishsound is implemented as a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and provides a consistent, higher-level programming interface. The motivation for this is twofold: to simplify the task of developing application software that supports these codecs, and to ensure that valid codec streams are generated.<h2><a class="anchor" name="history">
History</a></h2>
libfishsound was designed and developed by Conrad Parker on the weekend of October 18-19 2003. Previously the author had implemented Vorbis and Speex support in the following software:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/">Sweep</a>, a digital audio editor with decoding and GUI control of all encoding options of Vorbis and Speex</li><li>Speex support in the <a href="http://www.xinehq.org/">xine</a> multimedia player</li><li>Vorbis and Speex importers for <a href="http://www.annodex.net/software/libannodex/">libannodex</a>, the basic library for reading and writing <a href="http://www.annodex.net/">Annodex.net</a> media files.</li></ul>
<p>
The implementation of libfishsound draws heavily on these sources, and in turn the original example sources of libvorbis and libvorbisenc by Monty, and libspeex by Jean-Marc Valin.<p>
The naming of libfishsound reflects both the Xiph.Org logo and the author's reputation as a dirty, smelly old fish.<h2><a class="anchor" name="limitations">
Limitations</a></h2>
libfishsound has been designed to accomodate the various decoding and encoding styles required by a wide variety of software. However, as it is an abstraction of the underlying libvorbis, libvorbisenc and libspeex libraries, it may not be possible to implement some low-level techniques that these libraries enable, such as parallelization of Vorbis sub-block decoding. Nevertheless it is expected that libfishsound is a useful API for most software requiring Vorbis or Speex support, including most applications the author has encountered.<h2><a class="anchor" name="acknowledgements">
Acknowledgements</a></h2>
Much of the API design follows the style of <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a>. The author would like to thank Erik de Castro Lopo for feedback on the design of libfishsound. </div>
