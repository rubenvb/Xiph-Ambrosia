Force feeding involves synchronously:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Creating an {\itshape ogg\_\-packet\/} structure
\item Adding it to the packet queue with \doxyref{oggz\_\-write\_\-feed()}{p.}{group__write__api_ga6ccaceb107db1fd2eae047dbdbaa5889}
\item Calling \doxyref{oggz\_\-write()}{p.}{group__write__api_ga3c97d94ea425d64546adf9c368b71904} or \doxyref{oggz\_\-write\_\-output()}{p.}{group__write__api_ga5606dff01964caec4582eb172fde0c1c}, repeatedly as necessary, to generate the Ogg bitstream. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following example code generates a stream of ten packets, each containing a single byte ('A', 'B', ... , 'J'):
